```

### Coding

Wahoo! We're almost ready to start coding. All we need to do now, is to install the dependencies, and spin up the development sever.

First off, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned your forked repository. Then run the following command:

```
yarn && yarn dev
```

Give it a few seconds, and then you've gto a local development server running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
